GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 17 of 76 payments to women who were forced to have sex with Epstein and/or recruited others to be victimized. Defendants Indyke and Kahn obtained large and frequent stocks of cash for Epstein which, based on public knowledge, would have funded Epstein’s cash payments for “massages”—code for forced sex. 78. Defendants Indyke and Kahn participated with Epstein in coercing his sex trafficking victims, in at least three cases, to enter into arranged and forced marriages in order to obtain immigration status for the foreign women so that they could continue to be available to Epstein for his abuse – a doubly-deep assault on their will and dignity. Defendant Kahn provided a letter of reference for at least one immigration application and tax services to the spouses, and Defendant Indyke paid the immigration lawyer who applied for citizenship for the women and threatened at least one who indicated that she would seek a divorce. They used their professional skills and authority to carry out this abhorrent scheme. 79. Indyke and Kahn were, in short, the indispensable captains of Epstein’s criminal enterprise, roles for which they were richly rewarded. 80. Defendants Kahn and Indyke controlled and directed the activities of the other entities and personal bank accounts of Epstein accounts after they were funded. One, and frequently both, of them were officers or directors of Butterfly Trust; of companies holding Epstein’s real property (as laid out below); and of Financial Strategy Group, Ltd.; Financial Trust, Inc.; FT Real Estate Inc.; Gratitude America, Inc.; Hyperion Air, Inc.; J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc.; Jeepers, Inc.; Mort, Inc.; Nautilus, Inc.; and Zorro Development Corporation; among others. 81. Along with their officer and director roles, Defendants Kahn and/or Indyke also had signatory authority over virtually all of the accounts held by the Epstein Enterprise entities,

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 18 of 76 which allowed them to personally authorize and sign off on payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Enterprise’s sex-trafficking and abuse victims, including those who also acted as recruiters, and other expenses including legal fees, apartment rent, and tuition. Further, they routinely withdrew cash in various ways, including ATMs, checks, or by converting U.S. Dollars to Euros. In many instances, Kahn and/or Indyke structured these transactions in order to evade the bank’s reporting requirements. 82. Defendant Kahn also oversaw the accounting and tax reporting for the other entities in the Epstein Enterprise. As discussed below the “Tree entities,” Laurel, Maple, and Cypress, filed materially false and misleading financial statements by not including the properties in other states they owned or related expenses. These financial statements were submitted to the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands and signed by Defendant Kahn. In addition, in 2013, Defendant Kahn also directed the outside accountant not to report the properties on their respective tax returns. 83. The J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt private foundation that was founded in June 2000 and registered in the Virgin Islands. 84. As of October 23, 2007, Indyke was listed as President of the Foundation. He also was a signatory on the Foundation’s checking accounts. 85. Between September 2015 and June 2019, Indyke signed Foundation account checks for over $400,000 made payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model who received over $380,000 through monthly payments of $8,333 made over a period of more than three and a half years until the middle of 2019.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 19 of 76 86. In November 2017, Indyke signed a Foundation check made payable to the immigration lawyer in New York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status. The check’s memo line references the former Russian model’s last name. 87. These payments were inconsistent with the charitable purpose of the Foundation and designed to serve the private benefit and criminal activities of Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise. 88. Earlier in 2017, Indyke signed a Foundation check for $160,000 to resolve a fine Epstein had incurred for construction on Great St. James Island that violated Virgin Islands environmental regulations and attempted to make the payment appear to be a charitable donation. Over two years later, the Estate had to repay this amount to the Foundation after questions were raised to Epstein’s lawyer about the propriety of the Foundation payment. 89. With help from Indyke and Kahn, Epstein established and operated separate businesses through which he could pay victims and recruiters, and, upon information and belief, which he used to maintain their immigration status. 90. JSC Interiors, LLC is a New York Limited Liability Company, the Articles of Organization of which were filed in November 2014. The Articles list JSC, who was forced and coerced to have sex with Epstein, as the company’s sole owner. JSC was manipulated, exploited, and controlled by the Epstein Enterprise. 91. According to JSC’s operating agreement, Kahn was to be the initial Manager of the company, with full and complete authority, power, and discretion to do all things necessary or convenient to manage, control, and carry out the business. Kahn also had signatory authority for JSC’s bank accounts.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 20 of 76 92. One of JSC’s bank accounts was funded entirely with money transferred from Epstein’s personal bank accounts. 93. JSC’s payroll was paid to two persons, one of whom was the listed sole owner. Kahn gave conflicting reports to JSC’s bank about the second person on the company’s payroll and the reasons for its payments to her. Once, he described her as an interior designer, which would justify the payments in light of JSC’s purported line of business, but which appears to have been false. The other time, Kahn described this payroll recipient as a dentist, which would not justify JSC Interiors’ payments to her, but which appears to be true. 94. LSJE, LLC is a Virgin Islands Limited Liability Company that was organized on October 27, 2011. Defendants Indyke and Kahn were authorized signatories on the company’s checking account. 95. Indyke and Kahn signed company checks for combined value of almost $300,000 made out personally to young women or to, again, the immigration lawyer in New York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status. 96. Upon information and belief, after his guilty plea in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor, Epstein began to focus on procuring and abusing women from Eastern Europe. These women’s immigration status and language barriers made them more isolated, dependent, and vulnerable to Epstein’s abuse and manipulation. 97. The Butterfly Trust is a trust created for the benefit of numerous persons who performed work for Epstein, including numerous young women with Eastern European surnames and also including Indyke and Kahn themselves. Indyke and Kahn were authorized signatories on the Trust’s checking account.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 22 of 76 104. Also, Indyke withdrew large amounts of cash in single transactions. For instance, on January 17, 2018, Indyke cashed a check for $100,000. Although Indyke cashed the check, Kahn arranged with the Bank representative to have the cash ready for pickup. 105. Payments from this account, for which Indyke had signatory authority, totaling over $2,500,000 were made to dozens of women with Eastern European surnames, purportedly for hotel expenses, tuition, and rent, and to, again, the immigration lawyer in New York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure victims’ immigration status. 106. For another of Epstein’s personal accounts with the same bank, Indyke, from 2014 to 2016, made almost 45 separate check-cashing withdrawals at a pace of two to three per month, each for the amount of $7,500, which was the bank’s limit for third-party withdrawals. 107. From this same account, between June 2014 and September 2015, Indyke wrote eight checks for the purpose of converting U.S. dollars to Euros. Each of the checks to effectuate the conversion approximated $7,500, presumably in order to evade reporting requirements, with some containing the notation “Euros for safe.” 108. Payments from this account totaling over $1,000,000 were made to dozens of women with Eastern European surnames and to, again, the immigration lawyer in New York who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status. 109. Indyke made wire transfers from another of Epstein’s personal accounts with a different bank totaling almost $50,000 between November 2016 and July 2019 (just before Epstein’s arrest) to women with Eastern European surnames, including one known to have recruited young women and girls for Epstein.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 23 of 76 110. From another of Epstein’s personal accounts with another different bank, for which Indyke had signatory authority, someone acting on Epstein’s behalf made a total of 21 separate withdrawals each in the amount of $1,000 on every but one business day from April 9, 2019 to May 8, 2019. 111. Payments from this account totaling almost $60,000 were transferred by wire to young women mostly at foreign beneficiary banks in February and March 2016. 112. Upon information and belief, based on their authority for the accounts, their interactions with the relevant banks, and records indicating that they made or approved the transactions, these payments could have only been made with the knowledge and/or at the direction of Indyke and Kahn. 113. The sheer complexity of the infrastructure that Epstein set up and maintained with the participation of Kahn and Indyke suggest their unlawful purpose. Based on the Government’s current knowledge, Epstein, with Kahn and Indyke, held and managed at least 140 different bank accounts for Epstein and Epstein-owned entities, many of which existed only to transfer payments to other entities and accounts. 114. Kahn and Indyke profited substantially from their relationship with Epstein. The amount of their payments is further evidence of the illicit nature of the work they performed. 115. From 2011 to 2019, Epstein and Epstein-owned entities paid over $16 million net to Defendant/Co-Executor Indyke, and over $10 million net to Defendant/Co-Executor Kahn. This includes loans that are still outstanding to Indyke- and Kahn-related entities. Based on records obtained so far, tax forms provided by Epstein entities did not report nearly the full compensation to Indyke and Kahn.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 33 of 76 159. The EDC granted Southern Trust Company a 10-year package of economic incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the Virgin Islands. 160. Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, 11 served in administrative or support roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a driver/helper, one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll functions (though only one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one network administrator/IT manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 161. In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perform other personal services for Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the Virgin Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, which listed an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver and picked up luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf. 162. Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11B, New York, New York. Epstein's address book lists various units in this building as providing "Apt. for models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise used modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young women into its sex trafficking scheme. 163. Financial records more recently obtained show that the employee described above whom Kahn represented to be, alternatively, an interior designer and a dentist, was also a

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 34 of 76 paid employee of Southern Trust Company, which did not actually or even pretend to perform either interior design or dentistry services, in 2019. 164. During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affirmed to EDC that it had no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 165. Southern Trust company does not appear to have had any clients and performed no visible informatics services. According to financial records, it held no investments for others. Instead, its employees performed tasks related to any number of other Epstein-owned companies or properties, such as Little St. James. 166. Despite having no visible clients and only one full-time employee working on information technology during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly generated net income of $50.3 million in 2013, $67.5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and $4.8 million in 2016 and $17.1 million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, $170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income for the period of $656 million. 167. Money received by Southern Trust was then funneled, frequently by Defendant Indyke as authorized signatory, and often with copies given to Defendant Kahn, through other Epstein-owned entities and accounts, funding payments to foreign women and for credit cards, airplanes, and other instrumentalities of the Epstein Enterprise. 168. In fact, the main source of funds for the Epstein Enterprise came from Southern Trust. Between 2013 and 2017, Southern Trust reported approximately $184 million in revenues. 169. Defendants Kahn and Indyke directed and controlled the day-to-day activities of Southern Trust in form and in substance, serving as members of its Board of Directors, along with Epstein.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 37 of 76 182. Epstein appears to have maintained divided ownership of these properties, transferred ownership of them to the Virgin Islands, and then concealed this fact even from Virgin Islands authorities in an attempt to shield the properties from any judgment in the states where they are located. 183. The financial statements submitted by each of these three Defendant corporations to the Office of Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands were false and misleading due to their failure to include the above properties owned by each company or the related expenses incurred by each company, such as property taxes. 184. For instance, Cypress’s Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash of $18,824. Further, Cypress reported only $301 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $106,394.60 in Santa Fe property taxes on November 6, 2018. 185. Similarly, in 2017, Cypress reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $29,736 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $55,770.41 and $113,679.56 in Santa Fe property taxes during 2017. 186. Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Cypress did not include the value of the New Mexico property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses related to the New Mexico property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 187. Likewise, Maple’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash of $21,265. Further, Maple reported only $300 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $336,471.87 in New York City property taxes during 2018.

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 38 of 76 188. Similarly, in 2017, Maple reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $18,281 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $327,497.48 and $6,487.04 in New York City property taxes during 2017. 189. Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Maple did not include the value of the New York property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses related to the New York property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 190. Likewise, Laurel’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 did not reflect any assets other than cash in the amount of $20,155. Further, Laurel reported only $300 in expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, despite it paying $196,673.56 in Palm Beach property taxes on November 6, 2018. 191. Similarly, in 2017, Laurel reported as its only asset cash in the amount of $37,129 and expenses of $150, despite it paying $191,941.52 in Palm Beach property taxes on October 31, 2017. 192. Similarly, for the tax years 2011 through 2016, Laurel did not include the value of the Palm Beach property in the total assets it reported and did not include any expenses related to the Palm Beach property in the total expenses it reported to the Government. 193. Neither Cypress’s, Maple’s, nor Laurel’s financial statements ever reflected the reality of the above assets held or the above expenses incurred by each entity. 194. The Annual Reports submitted on behalf of Cypress, Maple, and Laurel all were signed by Epstein and Defendant and Co-Executor Kahn with the representation that “ALL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS APPLICATION, AND ANY ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS, ARE TRUE AND CORRECT . . .”

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein GVI’s Second Amended Complaint Page 40 of 76 200. Defendants used Epstein’s businesses and ostensibly charitable foundations in the Virgin Islands to make payments to the victims who were trafficked and sexually abused while concealing these payments from detection by law enforcement authorities. 201. Defendants also prevented Epstein Enterprise entity employees from cooperating with law enforcement by requiring them to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. 202. Defendants also actively obstructed law enforcement by denying investigators access to Little St. James beyond its boat dock. 203. Defendants also attempted to conceal their criminal sex trafficking and abuse conduct by paying large sums of money to participant-witnesses, including by paying for their attorneys’ fees and case costs in litigation related to this conduct. 204. Epstein also threatened harm to victims and helped release damaging stories about them to damage their credibility when they tried to go public with their stories of being trafficked and sexually abused. 205. Epstein also instructed one or more Epstein Enterprise participant-witnesses to destroy evidence relevant to ongoing court proceedings involving Defendants’ criminal sex trafficking and abuse conduct. 206. Defendants also concealed their fraud on the Government in obtaining unearned tax benefits by providing false testimony and submitting false and inaccurate reporting to the Economic Development Commission to prevent detection of Defendant Southern Trust Company’s non-compliance with requirements concerning the nature of its business and the residency of the persons it employed. 207. The discovery of the nature, scope, and magnitude of Defendants’ unlawful conduct and could not have been acquired earlier through the exercise of reasonable diligence.
